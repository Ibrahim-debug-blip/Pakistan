    <h1><strong>History of Karachi</strong></h1>
    <p><i>Karachi’s history is a sprawling narrative of transformation, evolving from a prehistoric coastal site into an ancient Greek harbor known as Krokola and eventually into the 18th-century fortified fishing village of Kolachi-jo-Goth. Named after the legendary matriarch Mai Kolachi, the settlement gained strategic importance under various regional powers like the Talpurs before falling to British forces in 1839. Under British rule, particularly after the annexation of Sindh in 1843, the city was meticulously developed into a premier imperial port; the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal and the expansion of the North Western State Railway turned it into a global hub for wheat and cotton exports, adorned with grand Victorian and Indo-Saracenic architecture. Upon the Partition of India in 1947, Karachi was designated as the first capital of Pakistan, triggering a massive demographic shift as hundreds of thousands of Urdu-speaking Muhajirs settled there, bringing a new cultural and intellectual vibrancy. Although the capital was moved to Islamabad in the 1960s, Karachi remained the nation's undisputed economic engine and "City of Lights," weathering decades of rapid urbanization, political flux, and ethnic diversity to emerge as a vital global megacity that generates the lion's share of Pakistan’s revenue and maritime trade.</i></p>
