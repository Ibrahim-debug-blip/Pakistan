    <h1><strong><mark>Clifton Sea-view</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Clifton Sea View, arguably the most iconic public space in Karachi, serves as the city’s primary gateway to the Arabian Sea and a vibrant pulse point of local culture. Stretching along the southern coast, this expansive sandy beach is famous for its silver-grey sands and the unique sight of illuminated floodlights that allow for nighttime seaside strolls, a rare feature for South Asian beaches. The shoreline is a bustling hub of activity where visitors can enjoy quintessential Karachi experiences, such as camel and horse rides decorated in traditional vibrant truck-art styles, or indulge in local street food like corn on the cob and spicy chaat. Over the years, the area has undergone significant modernization with the addition of the Chunrigar Road skyline backdrop and the nearby Oyster Rocks jutting out of the water. While the beach itself is a site for massive public gatherings and festivals, it is also flanked by high-end developments like Dolmen Mall Clifton and the Jehangir Kothari Parade, a historic British-era promenade that offers a more refined architectural perspective of the coast. Despite the challenges of urban pollution, Sea View remains the "great equalizer" of the city, where people from all walks of life gather to witness the dramatic Arabian Sea sunsets.</i></p>
