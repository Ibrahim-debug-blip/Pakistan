    <h1><mark><strong>Wazir Mansion</strong></mark></h1>
    <p><i>Wazir Mansion, officially known as the Quaid-e-Azam Birthplace Museum, is a three-storey National Monument located in the historic and densely populated Kharadar district of Karachi. Built between 1860 and 1870 using traditional yellow sandstone masonry with lime and jute mortar, the mansion exhibits striking colonial-era architectural features designed to withstand the city's coastal weather. It is primarily revered as the birthplace of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, who was born there on December 25, 1876, and spent roughly 16 years of his childhood and youth within its walls.

<p><i>The building was originally a family home before being acquired by the Government of Pakistan in 1953 and inaugurated as a museum on August 14 of that year. Today, it serves as a Museum and National Archive, featuring a public library and reading hall on the ground floor and museum galleries on the upper levels. These galleries house preserved personal artifacts, including Jinnah’s books, furniture, and rare photographs, offering visitors an intimate look at the environment that shaped the nation's leader.
