    <h1><strong><mark>Iqbal Park</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Greater Iqbal Park in Lahore is a 125-acre historical and recreational urban oasis. Originally known as Minto Park during the British Raj, the site is revered as the "hallowed ground" where the Lahore Resolution (later known as the Pakistan Resolution) was passed on March 23, 1940. This pivotal event, which formally called for an independent Muslim homeland, is commemorated by the iconic Minar-e-Pakistan, a 70-meter-tall national monument that serves as the park's centerpiece. After extensive renovations completed in 2016, the park now features modern amenities, including a four-acre artificial lake with an 800-foot-long musical fountain, a two-kilometer "soft rail" for buggy rides, and the state-of-the-art National History Museum, which uses digital technology like holograms and VR to showcase the Pakistan Movement. Strategically located between the Walled City of Lahore and the Lahore Fort, it also houses the final resting places of national poet Allama Iqbal and national anthem author Hafeez Jalandhari.
