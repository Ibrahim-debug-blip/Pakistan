    <h1><mark><strong>Lahore fort</strong></mark></h1>
    <p><i>The Lahore Fort, also known as Shahi Qila, is a monumental citadel in Lahore, Pakistan, that serves as a living chronicle of the Mughal Empire's architectural evolution. While the site’s origins date back to antiquity with an 11th-century mud-brick structure, the present brick-and-stone fortress was primarily shaped by Mughal Emperor Akbar starting in 1566. It is uniquely significant as the only site in Pakistan that captures every major phase of Mughal design—from Akbar's syncretic style featuring Hindu and Islamic motifs to the peak of opulence under Shah Jahan, who added the world-renowned Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors) and the white marble Naulakha Pavilion. 
The fort’s 20-hectare complex contains 21 distinct monuments, including the iconic Alamgiri Gate built by Aurangzeb, which faces the Badshahi Mosque, and the 1,450-foot-long Picture Wall decorated with vibrant glazed tile mosaics. Following the Mughal era, the fort served as the royal residence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh during the Sikh Empire and was later repurposed by the British Raj for military use. Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981, the fort continues to undergo extensive restoration led by the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) to preserve its historic murals and structural integrity for future generations.
