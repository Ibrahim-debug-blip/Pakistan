    <h1><mark><strong>Anarkali Bazaar</strong></mark></h1>
    <p><i>One of the oldest and most vibrant marketplaces in South Asia, Anarkali Bazaar in Lahore is a sprawling cultural landmark that has served as a central hub for trade and community for over 200 years. Located near the historic Mall Road, the bazaar is named after the legendary Mughal courtesan Anarkali, whose tragic love story with Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir) adds an air of romance and mystery to the area. The market is divided into two distinct sections: New Anarkali, a shopper's paradise renowned for its traditional handicrafts, intricate embroidery, and bridal wear found in sub-markets like Bano Bazaar; and Old Anarkali, a legendary food destination where visitors can sample authentic Lahori delicacies such as nihari, siri paye, and halwa puri. Beyond its commercial appeal, the bazaar is a treasure trove of heritage, housing the 1200-year-old Valmiki Mandir and the mausoleum of Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi. </i></p>
