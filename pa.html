    <h1><strong><mark>Pakistan Air force Museum Karachi</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Museum in Karachi stands as a sprawling 28-acre testament to the nation’s aviation heritage, blending military history with a family-oriented park atmosphere. Located on Shahrah-e-Faisal, the museum’s centerpiece is the Vickers VC.1 Viking, the personal aircraft of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, which is preserved in pristine condition. The outdoor displays feature over 30 aircraft, including the iconic F-86 Sabre flown by war hero M.M. Alam, the supersonic F-104 Starfighter, and captured Indian Air Force assets like the Folland Gnat. Beyond the jets, the indoor galleries house detailed dioramas, the "Shohada" (Martyrs) monument, and a dedicated section for "Operation Swift Retort" showcasing recent aerial history. For families, the museum offers a complete recreational experience with a food court, amusement rides, and lush gardens, though entry is strictly maintained for families and students to ensure a secure environment.</i></p>
