    <h1><mark><strong>Shalamar Garden</strong></mark></h1>
    <p><i>Built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1641–1642, the Shalamar Gardens in Lahore represent the pinnacle of Mughal landscape architecture and were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Designed as a Persian-style "Charbagh" paradise garden, the 80-acre complex is meticulously laid out on three descending terraces—Farah Baksh (Bestower of Pleasure), Faiz Baksh (Bestower of Goodness), and Hayat Baksh (Bestower of Life)—each separated by nearly five meters in elevation. The gardens are world-renowned for their sophisticated 17th-century hydraulic engineering, which powers 410 fountains that rise from large marble pools and flow into cascading water chutes called chadors to create a cooling atmosphere. Visitors can explore historic red sandstone and marble structures, including the Sawan Bhadun pavilions, royal sleeping chambers (Khwabgah), and the Shahi Hammam (Royal Bath). Today, the gardens remain a serene retreat and a popular spot for photography, especially during the "golden hour" or the annual Mela Chiraghan festival held in April. </i></p>
