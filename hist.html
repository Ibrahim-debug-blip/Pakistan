    <h1><mark><strong>History of Lahore</strong></mark></h1>
    <p><i>Lahore, known as the "Heart of Pakistan," boasts a rich history spanning over two millennia, with legends tracing its origin to Prince Loh, son of the Hindu deity Rama. While ancient accounts like the Hudud al-'Alam (982 CE) describe it as a prosperous town of temples and markets, the city rose to true prominence under the Ghaznavids in the 11th century when it became a provincial capital and center for Islamic culture. Its "Golden Age" occurred during the Mughal Empire (1524–1752), particularly under Emperors Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, who transformed it into a world-renowned metropolis of gardens and palaces, leaving behind masterpieces like the Lahore Fort, Shalimar Gardens, and the iconic Badshahi Mosque. Following the decline of the Mughals and a period of Afghan and Sikh conflicts, the city became the capital of the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1799, who refurbished many monuments while adding his own architectural legacy.
The British Raj annexed Lahore in 1849, introducing "Mughal-Gothic" architecture and establishing modern institutions such as Government College University and the Lahore Museum. Crucial to the Pakistan Movement, the city hosted the historic Lahore Resolution in 1940 at the site where Minar-e-Pakistan now stands. After independence in 1947, Lahore became the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province and continues to serve as a vibrant cultural and intellectual hub, blending its ancient Walled City with rapid modern urbanization.</i></p>
