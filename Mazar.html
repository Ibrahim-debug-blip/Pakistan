    <p><i>The Mazar-e-Quaid, or the Jinnah Mausoleum, serves as the iconic final resting place of Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and remains the most recognizable symbol of Karachi. Completed in 1971, the structure is a masterpiece of Modernist Islamic architecture, featuring a pure white marble dome and elegant tapered walls set upon a four-tiered platform. Designed by architect Yahya Merchant, the mausoleum is inspired by the Samanid Mausoleum in Uzbekistan, blending traditional motifs with a minimalist aesthetic. The interior is anchored by a magnificent crystal chandelier gifted by the People's Republic of China, which hangs over the symbolic sarcophagus. Surrounded by a vast 53-hectare park known as Bagh-e-Quaid, the site also houses the graves of other prominent leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Fatima Jinnah. Visitors can explore an on-site museum displaying Jinnah's personal belongings, such as his vintage cars and wardrobe, making it both a solemn national monument and a popular public space for citizens.</i></p>
