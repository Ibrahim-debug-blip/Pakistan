    <h1><strong><mark>Lahore Museum</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Established in 1865 and moved to its iconic red-brick home on The Mall in 1894, the Lahore Museum is Pakistan’s largest and oldest repository of cultural and historical artifacts. The building is a masterpiece of Indo-Saracenic architecture, designed by Sir Ganga Ram and John Lockwood Kipling—the former principal of the adjacent National College of Arts and father of novelist Rudyard Kipling. Kipling famously immortalized the museum as the "Wonder House" (Ajaib Ghar) in the opening scenes of his novel Kim. Inside, the museum houses over 60,000 artifacts across roughly 20 specialized galleries, meticulously chronicling the region's evolution from the prehistoric Indus Valley Civilization to modern Pakistan. 
The museum's most celebrated treasure is the Fasting Siddhartha (or Fasting Buddha), a 2nd-century Gandhara schist sculpture discovered at Sikri; it is world-renowned for its extraordinary anatomical realism, depicting the Buddha’s emaciated form during his years of asceticism. Other major highlights include one of the world's most extensive collections of Gandhara art, rare Mughal and Pahari miniature paintings, and a massive 48-panel ceiling mural by the legendary artist Sadequain titled The Evolution of Mankind. Visitors can also explore galleries dedicated to Islamic art, the Sikh Empire, and a Numismatic collection with roughly 40,000 ancient coins. </i></p>
